# React app with IE11

## Intro

```shell
// install modules
yarn
// build app for production
yarn build
// launch development server
yarn start
```

## Aim

study for babel setting for IE11 support.

If you want to compare bundle size with not IE11 support one, please check out `not-support-ie11` branch.

IE supported JavaScript application tend to be large size.

This is not good for web performance.
